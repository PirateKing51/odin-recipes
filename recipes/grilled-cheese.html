    <h2>My Best Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h2>

    <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is not diet food. So when I have one, it has to be great! Crispy, salty, buttery exterior and oozy, molten cheese inside. Are you ready to meet the ultimate cheese toastie??</p>
    
    <p>I realize it might seem strange to share a recipe for what is fundamentally just melted cheese between bread. And really, is there even such a thing as a bad grilled cheese? Perhaps not.</p>

    <p>But there is such a thing as a GREAT grilled cheese sandwich!</p>

    <p>So here are my two golden rules for my very best grilled cheese:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Use TWO types of cheese - mozzarella for stretch and another for flavour (gruyere and vintage cheddar are my favorites)</li>
        <li>Give your sandwich press a miss. Use a pan on your stove! Just look at the superior golden buttery crust you get to bite into!</li>

    </ol>
    
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 slices sourdough bread, <em>sliced 1.3-1.5cm thick (0.5-0.6")</em></li>
        <li>30g/ 2 tbsp SALTED butted, <em>for spread on bread (or unsalted + pinch of salt)</em></li>
        <li>1/3 cup (heaped) vintage cheddar cheese or gruyere, <em>freshly grated (or other melting cheese of choice)</em></li>
        <li>30g/ 1/3 cup mozzarella, <em>freshly grated</em></li>

    </ul>

    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Butter bread -</strong> Slather both sides of each piece of bread with the butter (yes, all 4 sides!)</li>
        <li><strong>Light toast- </strong>Heat a heavy-based skillet or frying pan over medium low heat (no oil or butter). Place both pieces of bread in the skillet and lightly toast for 1 minute to warm it through and create a light crust. (When we flip, this gives the cheese a head start).</li>
        <li><strong>Pile on cheese- </strong>Flip one slice of bread, then pile on the cheddar cheese followed by the mozzarella. Place the other slice of bread on top, with the hot toasted side in contact with the cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook 3 minutes- </strong>Cook for 3 minutes or until the bread is evenly golden and crisp, pressing down lightly with a spatula every now and then. If it's browning too quickly, remove remove from the stove to cool down a bit and lower heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip, 3 minutes- </strong>Turn the sandwich over, and cook the other side for 3 minutes or until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Devour- </strong>Transfer to cutting board. Cut in half in one swift motion. Admire cheese pull. Devour.</li>

    </ol>

    <h5>Recipe Notes:</h5>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note: </strong>The exact amount of butter and cheese you will need depends on the shape and size of your bread. My rule of thumb - more rather than less is better.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread- </strong>This recipe will work fine with any bread though you want to ensure it's not too thick (cheese might not melt), too thin or too soft (will get squished by the cheese), too holey (cheese-escape-routes). My favorite is a nice sourdough but not those super fancy ones that come with a crazy thick, tough teeth-breaking crust. Just a normal, good sourdough is all you need!</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese Options- </strong>For the best grilled cheese, you want to use a combination of mozzarella (for its cheese pull and non-greasy melting qualities) with a flavoured cheese - because mozzarella actually has a very mild flavour. A good vintage cheddar or gruyere are my absolute favorites.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, I'll use anything and everything - tasty, Monterey Jack, colby, swiss, cheddar. Just give me my grilled cheese!!!</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese slices </strong>work fine but honestly, you get a better melt using shredded.  I promise. (I've had a lot of experience with both!)  Please grate your own - packed shredded has anti caking agents, never melts as well.</li>
    </ul>
